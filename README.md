The objective of the project is to build a digital circuit, in VHDL, capable of performing arithmetic
operations with two integers in twoâ€™s complement, inserted in the digital systems using
switches. The arithmetic operator to be used and the operands are inserted at different times,
since the switches for choosing the operator and the operands are the same. The arithmetic
operator, the operands and the final result should be shown in the LEDs. The state of the systems
must be signalled using the RGB LEDs. The digital circuit is to be implemented and tested on the
PYNQ-Z2 development board, based on the Zynq-7000 FPGA.
